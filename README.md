Welcome to the official repository for the upcoming work: EffectiveVideoLLM.

## Overview
EffectiveVideoLLM focuses on achieving a delicate balance between performance and token consumption in video llm. 

## What to Expect
In the following weeks, we will be releasing the following components:
- **Data:** ~1M high-quality synthetic data collected by us for Video QA.
- **Model Checkpoint:** Pre-trained model checkpoints 8B/70B.
- **Training Code:** Code to reproduce the experiments.

We are continuously improving the model's performance.

Stay tuned for updates!
